His movie debut and first starring movie role was the 1961 science fiction movie <i>Invasion of the Neptune Men</i>. Later that year, Chiba appeared in the first Kinji Fukasaku film, <i>Wandering Detective: Tragedy in Red Valley</i> which marked the beginning of a long series of collaborations for the two. Over the next decade, he was cast primarily in crime thrillers. He also adopted the <a href=#>English</a> name Sonny Chiba, initially because of his association with a Toyota advertising campaign for a car called the "Sunny-S". By 1970, Chiba had started his own training school for aspiring martial arts film actors and stunt performers known as J.A.C (Japan Action Club). He starred in the <i>Karate Kiba</i> (<i>Bodyguard Kiba</i>), after appearing on the <i>Battles Without Honor and Humanity: Hiroshima Deathmatch</i> in 1973. <i>Karate Kiba</i> was the first movie for him about martial arts. Chiba's breakthrough international hit was <i>The Street Fighter</i> (1974), which established him as the reigning <a href=#>Japanese</a> martial arts actor in international cinema for the next two decades.</p><span>1965</span><p>Chiba went to the Nippon Sport Science University in 1957. He was a serious candidate for a place in the <a href=#>Japanese</a> Olympic team in his late teens until he was sidelined by a back injury. While he was a university student, he began studying martial arts with the renowned Kyokushin Karate master Masutatsu "Mas" Oyama (whom he later portrayed in a trilogy of films), which led to a first-degree black belt on October 15, 1965, later receiving a fourth-degree on January 20, 1984.</p><span>1975</span><p>His subsequent projects included such pictures as <i>The Bullet Train</i> (1975), <i>Karate Warriors</i> (1976), <i>Doberman Cop</i> (1977), <i>Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon</i> (1977) and <i>The <a href=#>Assassin</a></i> (1977). He also occasionally returned to the science fiction genre, in movies such as <i>Message from Space</i> (1978). He began to star also on some jidaigeki such as <i>Shogun's Samurai</i> (1978), <i>The Fall of Ako Castle</i> (1978), <i>G.I. Samurai</i> (1979), <i>Shadow Warriors</i> (1980), <i>Samurai Reincarnation</i> (1981). He was not only actor but also stunt coordinator at <i>G.I. Samurai</i>, <i>Burning Brave</i> (1981), <i>Shogun's <a href=#>Shadow</a></i> (1989) and executive <a href=#>Producer</a>, film <a href=#>Director</a> at <i>Yellow Fangs</i> (1990).</p><span>1980</span><p>Chiba was even busier in the 1980s, doing dozens of movies as well as making forays into television, and with roles in such high-profile adventures as the popular Hong Kong comic-based movie: <i>The Storm Riders</i> (1998), starring alongside Ekin Cheng and Aaron Kwok. His fame in Japan remained unabated into the 1990s.</p><span>1996</span><p>Chiba divorced his first wife, <a href=#>Actress</a> Yoko Nogiwa with whom he has a daughter, <a href=#>Juri Manase</a>, also an <a href=#>Actress</a>. He has two sons from his second marriage; child actor <a href=#>Mackenyu</a> Arata <span style=font-weight:400>(<span lang=ja>新田真剣佑</span> <i>Arata Makken'yū</i>)</span> born on November 16, 1996 and Gordon <span style=font-weight:400>(<span lang=ja>郷敦</span>)</span>, born in 1998. He currently lives in Yokohama, Japan. His younger brother, Jirō Yabuki (also known as Jiro Chiba), was also an actor.</p><span>2003</span><p>In his fifties, the actor resumed working under the name Shinichi Chiba when he served as a <a href=#>Choreographer</a> of martial arts sequences. At the dawn of the 21 century, Chiba was as busy as ever in feature films and also starring in his own series in Japan. Roles in Takashi Miike's <i>Deadly Outlaw: Rekka</i> and his work with <a href=#>Directors</a> Kenta and Kinji Fukasaku's <i>Battle Royale II</i> effectively bridged the gap between modern day and yesteryear cinematic cult legends. Chiba's enduring onscreen career received a tribute when he appeared in a key role as Hattori Hanzo, the owner of a <a href=#>Su Shi</a> restaurant and retired samurai sword craftsman, in <a href=#>Director</a> Quentin Tarantino's bloody revenge epic <i>Kill Bill</i> in 2003.</p><span>2007</span><p>Chiba has starred in more than 125 films for Toei Studios and has won numerous awards in Japan for his acting. In November 2007, he announced the retirement of the stage name <i>Shinichi Chiba</i> and will now be known (in Japan) as <i>J.J. Sonny Chiba</i> <span style=font-weight:400>(<span lang=ja>ＪＪサニー千葉</span> <i>Justice Japan Sonny Chiba</i>)</span> as an actor and <i>Rindō Wachinaga</i> <span style=font-weight:400>(<span lang=ja>和千永 倫道</span> <i>Wachinaga Rindō</i>)</span> as a film <a href=#>Director</a>.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1939 births</a> <a href=#>Japanese male actors</a> <a href=#>Japanese male judoka</a> <a href=#>Japanese wushu practitioners</a> <a href=#>Japanese male karateka</a> <a href=#>Japanese kendoka</a> <a href=#>Japanese ninjutsu practitioners</a> <a href=#>People from Fukuoka</a> <a href=#>People from Chiba Prefecture</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>Kyokushin kaikan practitioners</a> <a href=#>Gōjū-ryū practitioners</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmejnbavecicn6Jlk522o62Mp5ytZaekv7W0jHBua29k</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshin-ichi-chiba-net-worth-77274.html&text=Shin%27ichi%20Chiba%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshin-ichi-chiba-net-worth-77274.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshin-ichi-chiba-net-worth-77274.html&title=Shin%27ichi%20Chiba%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshin-ichi-chiba-net-worth-77274.html&title=Shin%27ichi%20Chiba%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshin-ichi-chiba-net-worth-77274.html&title=Shin%27ichi%20Chiba%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshin-ichi-chiba-net-worth-77274.html&description=Shin%27ichi%20Chiba%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./whats-deans-job-the-bachelor-winter-games-star-is-falling-in-line-with-bachelor-nation-sponcon-8208845.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What's Dean's Job?
