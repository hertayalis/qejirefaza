Additionally, not every skin tone or hair color is a candidate for at-home devices — red, blonde, and gray hair and dark brown and Black skin are not safe candidates. In those cases, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>waxing kits</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>hair removal creams</a> may be a better DIY bet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Multiple treatments over the course of several weeks are necessary to stop or slow down the hair growth cycle. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>We individually tested </a>13 devices to see which ones earned top ratings for ease of use, low-pain experience, and hair reduction after 12 weeks, then consulted four board-certified dermatologists to answer our burning q's on laser hair removal.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>At a Glance: At-Home Laser Hair Removal Devices</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>INSTYLE / ABBY MILLIGAN</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-ulike-sapphire-air-ipl-hair-removal-handset></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ulike Sapphire AIR+</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulike Sapphire AIR+ IPL Hair Removal Handset" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NL2raxWu7hQrraodCHd3aXDLONc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ulike-sapphire-air--dark-green-ipl-hair-removal-handset-72732cf48ab847d0b4f3a7f2a519245e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulike</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The inclusion of accessories impressed us right off the bat with this device. Inside the box, we found a razor, razor case, protective glasses with a leather case, leather travel case for the device, and a power cord and power box. While using the device, we not only noticed how easy it was to maneuver around the desired areas, but also how it didn’t bother our skin surface at all — no welts, burns, scars, or texture changes were detected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The first two intensity settings were hardly noticeable, but the third level gave a faint zapping sensation. Level four was more uncomfortable, similar to someone snapping a tiny rubber band against skin. The fifth had the same snap, but was much more intense. However, thanks to the “refrigerated chip” on the applicator and the cool sensation it provided, our skin remained comfortable and never felt too warm.&nbsp;Finally, when it came to results, we saw a strong reduction in the thickness and speed of hair growth in the third and fourth weeks. While we loved this device, we can unfortunately only recommend it to those with darker hair and lighter skin. If you scroll down the product page, the brand provides you with a chart describing which skin and hair types are best for this device.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Results: </strong>4 weeks <strong>| FDA Approved: </strong>Yes <strong>| Intensity Levels: </strong>5<strong> | Hair Type: </strong>Dark <strong>| Body Area: </strong>All<strong> | Flashes: </strong>N/A</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-nood-the-flasher-20></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>nood The Flasher 2.0</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="nood The Flasher 2.0" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/y5Itlqr61D7bcUy5saxVfWuiD3E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nood-the-flasher-20-88f5802b0fdb4c89beb20d0d93b27f57.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>NOOD</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Out of the seven settings, we were recommended by the brand to use the two most intense options, and we found that the sixth setting (the second highest setting) was equally as effective as the seventh (the highest). The large laser area makes it tricky to reach tight precision spots —&nbsp; this device isn’t really for delicacy, but for boldness and speed.&nbsp;We did feel a light zap every once in a while, but it was very minimal and not bothersome. In just about 15 minutes, we had finished zapping both legs. Throw in the armpits too, and that added about five more minutes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After using it twice a week during the testing period, we could see solid improvement by the second week. We chalked up its surprising speediness to the fact that our hair is dark but thin (a laser hair removal device’s dream hair type).&nbsp;And as a surprise bonus, we noticed the scars on our legs getting a little lighter in color as well. For a device under $200, we’re pleased to report how effective it is.&nbsp;The low price point also helped us overlook that the device is built for efficiency and does not include additional accessories.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FDA Approved: </strong>Yes<strong> | Intensity Levels: </strong>7<strong> | Hair Type: </strong>Dark <strong>| Body Area: </strong>All <strong>| Flashes: </strong>600k</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-roseskinco-lumi-ipl-hair-removal-handset></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Travel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RoseSkinCo.

It comes with an exfoliating glove, to prep our skin 24 hours before the treatment. Unlike the previous two options, this one has three different modes in addition to six intensity settings. Each mode is designed for a specific body part. The “stamp” mode was intended to treat the bikini lines and armpits, delivering pulses with each click. On the other hand, we used the “glide” mode for our arms since we could go over our arm in one long stroke without needing to repeatedly press any buttons. Our legs got the “auto” mode treatment, which powers on when the device touches the skin and stays on until you remove it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found our more sensitive areas couldn’t handle more than the third intensity (and we even consider ourselves to have a high pain tolerance). Still, we saw the biggest difference on our arms. Our armpits, however, took much longer, likely due to the thicker hair follicles in that area. Despite the occasional discomfort, no marks or redness were left on the skin. After 12 weeks, hair growth had significantly slowed down.&nbsp;Our only disappointment was the shape of the device. We would have preferred a handle with an hourglass shape or one with ridges to prevent slipping.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FDA Approved: </strong>Yes<strong> | Intensity Levels: </strong>6<strong> | Hair Type: </strong>Dark<strong> | Body Area: </strong>Any<strong> | Flashes: </strong>900k</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-lighter-hair-iluminage-touch-4ever-home-permanent-hair-removal-ipl--radio-frequency-system></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Lighter Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Iluminage Home Permanent Hair Removal System</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Iluminage Touch 4ever Home Permanent Hair Removal IPL &amp;amp; Radio Frequency System" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CAS07jNBtA93nDHz5ikIXesL6-k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/iluminage-touch-permanent-hair-reduction-system--d5c2a4cba1114131a40e26ad91cc7aa2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skinstore</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Laser hair removal devices tend to play favorites with dark hair. That’s because the laser targets the melanin within dark hair to slow down growth. We were skeptical about this brand’s claim that it can target light hairs, but we can confirm it did reduce hair thickness and new growth on our lighter body hair. Although an electric razor (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>epilator)</a> was included with the kit, it was difficult to use and the manual wasn’t as helpful as we hoped, so we just used our regular razor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even so, it must be said that laser hair removal devices will always work better on dark hair. After lasering our legs once a week at its highest intensity level (three), our hair began to grow back slower and in patches, and continued to dwindle as the weeks went on.&nbsp;Don’t expect to throw your razor away after 12 weeks, as it did not completely remove our body hair, but we're hopeful that with continued use we'll see further results. And as an added bonus, we experienced no pain during the sessions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FDA Approved: </strong>Yes<strong> | Intensity Levels: </strong>3 <strong>| Hair Type: </strong>All <strong>| Body Area: </strong>Any<strong> | Flashes: </strong>300k</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-skin-silkn-infinity-hair-removal-device></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Sensitive Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Silk'n Infinity Hair Removal Device</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Silk'n Infinity Hair Removal Device" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nWjGXnUGQeZJCzpNzJ5rYY5t73k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/silkn-infinity-hair-removal-device-2ef7b98fdca447a28a374579c9ee8524.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Silkn</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have sensitive skin, we totally get the concern about using a heated laser anywhere on the body (and we recommend consulting your doctor for any skin-specific concerns). To our surprise, this device triggered neither redness or sensitivity, so we ramped it up and found that only the highest setting (setting number five) caused some kind of warm feeling, but it was far from uncomfortable or irritating.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The device itself is rather large, but still lightweight. Our arms didn’t get tired from holding it during our sessions at all. Thanks to the two modes glide and pulse, we were able to treat our selected areas with care and precision. We used the glide for larger surface areas and the pulse for bikini lines.&nbsp;It took a little longer to see results with this one, probably because the directions recommended using the laser only once every two weeks. At week five, we noticed our hair grew in much slower and thinner than before. The price of this device is roughly the same price as one clinical visit for a treatment. That makes the near-infinite uses you get out of this a great value.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FDA-Approved: </strong>No <strong>| Intensity Levels: </strong>5 <strong>| Hair Type: </strong>All<strong> | Body Area: </strong>Any <strong>| Flashes: </strong>N/A</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-jovs-venus-pro-ii-hair-remover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Beginners</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jovs Venus Pro II</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="JOVS Venus Pro II Hair Remover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FKMYwGNdmU0lv8sbIffjchyDwhA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jovs-venus-pro-ii-hair-remover-a9ffad76afae4a1db6644af47b95fe3a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>JOVS</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The true stand-out feature was the rotating head, which made it a complete breeze to reach small areas. The second best detail are the six modes and each has a different purpose: One for arms, underarms, bikini, legs, face, and even skin rejuvenation. These very clear modes eliminated the guessing game as to which setting we needed to use. There is also a cool setting, which helped soothe each area and reduce irritation…which leads us to our only con.&nbsp; We felt little hot flashes on our armpits specifically, but it is a tender area to begin with, and it wasn’t significant enough to really bother us.

The manual requested that we use it only once a week at first, then increase it to two to three times a week. After 12 weeks, we saw much thinner and slow-to-grow hair.&nbsp;The package came with a razor and goggles, which we also took full advantage of.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FDA Approved: </strong>Yes <strong>| Intensity Levels: </strong>6 <strong>| Hair Type: </strong>Dark, some shades of blonde <strong>| Body Area: </strong>Any <strong>&nbsp;| Flashes: </strong>Unlimited</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-bikini-smoothskin-pure-mini-intelligent-ultrafast-ipl-permanent-hair-reduction></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Bikini</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SmoothSkin Pure Mini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SmoothSkin Pure Mini Intelligent Ultrafast IPL Permanent Hair Reduction" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MUpETMhGopWKjLmH7MZjJS40uCw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/smoothskin-pure-mini-intelligent-ultrafast-ipl-permanent-hair-reduction-for-women--men---body--face--fda-cleared--2ac6a87d564c41259d1b5cdb902b6c5b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're prone to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bumps on your bikini line</a>, laser hair removal is a viable alternative to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>bikini waxes</a>. We loved this device for its compact size and lightweight nature, making it easy to glide or pulse (depending on the setting you choose) over the bikini area. This mini sized version is a little less intense than their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">full-size one</a>, and therefore, much friendlier on sensitive areas.

Because it left no marks, stings, or redness, it was otherwise impossible to detect whether or not the laser was in use. We loved this feature for the bikini line specifically, but got tedious for larger areas, like the leg. It took a solid five weeks for us to see results. On our legs, there were some very clear bare patches. However, we saw no change in density or speed for the hair that did continue to grow. After 12 weeks, the skin was fairly evened out, with only minimal stray, stubborn bits of hair standing their ground.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FDA Approved: </strong>Yes <strong>| Intensity Levels: </strong>2 <strong>| Hair Type: </strong>Dark to dirty blonde<strong> | Body Area: </strong>All<strong> | Flashes: </strong>Unlimited</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-we-learned-about-laser-hair-removal></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What We Learned About Laser Hair Removal</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Skin Color: </strong>Those with darker skin (in this case, 4 or above on the Fitzpatrick scale) should seek out a professional. Individuals with darker skin tones must go to someone with experience treating skin of color because there is a higher risk of getting burned by the laser, says board-certified dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon Dr. Dustin Portela.&nbsp;The Nd:YAG lasers can be used on all skin colors.</li><li><strong>Time to Results: </strong>Laser hair removal typically requires several sessions to achieve optimal results, as hair grows in cycles and not all hairs are in the same stage of growth at the same time. While some brands claim to see results in as little as a few weeks, we found 12 weeks had initial reduction and a full 6 months was needed to see the final result. The number of sessions required can vary depending on individual skin and hair characteristics, as well as the area being treated.</li><li><strong>Pain</strong>: How painful we found the process was dependent on our individual tolerance as well as the device's intensity settings. Some testers with a high pain tolerance found their device just to feel warm, whereas other testers likened the process to repeated rubber band snaps.<br></li><li><strong>PCOS:</strong> A common side effect of polycystic ovarian syndrome is excess hair growth. The hair is often thick, coarse, dark, and shows up on the face, chest, and back. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Laser hair removal for those with PCOS</a> is an effective treatment method, however, be aware you may require more sessions due to its density and increased number of hairs.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Intensity Settings:</strong> Generally speaking, the higher the intensity, the more effective the treatment. However, an intense setting typically makes skin more vulnerable to pain or irritation.&nbsp;Devices with six or seven settings give you a little more options along the spectrum to choose from.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Modes:</strong> The variety of “modes” refers to how the laser’s lights are distributed. The stamp mode is ideal for smaller surface areas and distributes lasers only when you press the button. A glide mode is ideal as it can slide over larger surfaces, making the whole process a lot smoother, faster, and less likely to miss a spot. The auto mode zaps on so long as it makes contact with the skin, and can be glided over the surface in a similar fashion.&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Price: </strong>According to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>American Academy of Dermatology</a>, in-office laser hair removal takes two to six sessions spaced four to weeks apart. The latest statistics show, on average, in-office laser hair removal costs $582 per session, per the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>American Society of Plastic Surgeons</a>. The devices on our list range from $189 to $449. The difference in price stems from size of the device, number of flashes, as well as additional accessories, like goggles or epilators included.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How long laser does hair removal last?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Is it permanent? Is it temporary? How long must I go on being hairy? All valid questions and Dr. Portela has some answers. “For most people who undergo laser hair removal, the results will last for years,” he says. “Occasionally some hair will grow back after some time but it is usually much less noticeable than before your treatment.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, “At-home laser hair removal devices are far less powerful than those used in a professional setting,” says Dr. Shokeen. “This means that it may take much longer to achieve the same results, and the results may not be as consistent.” In the end, celebrity cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank sets expectations by saying “the goal to permanently remove hair to 100 percent is usually unrealistic. Most patients require four to seven treatments to get 85 percent or greater hair reduction.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is laser hair removal safe?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At-home laser hair removal is safe for many people. As mentioned above, those with darker skin tones should seek a dermatologist before using any of the mentioned devices. Because the laser targets melanin, there’s a chance you can experience burning if done incorrectly. For other skin tones: you might notice some zapping and a light burning sensation, but this is to be expected. However Dr. Camp warns that “if not used according to instructions, at-home lasers can be associated with redness, blisters, burns, and discoloration.” If this happens, seek a doctor.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should I prep my skin for laser hair removal?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You have to shave the treatment area prior to exposure, says Dr. Camp. “Hair sticking above the skin will absorb the energy of the laser, making the treatment less effective and increasing the chances of skin burn.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Dr. Shokeen says that even after treatment, “it’s important to keep the treated area clean and hydrated.” She also advises avoiding “harsh soaps or scrubs, as this can irritate the skin.”&nbsp;Remember that your skin has just been repeatedly zapped, and is in a vulnerable, sensitive state. “Avoid exposing the treated area to direct sunlight or tanning beds,” says Dr. Shokeen.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky</a> is a commerce writer at InStyle, with over two years of experience covering the best fashion and beauty finds.
