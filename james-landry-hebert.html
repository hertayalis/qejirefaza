The Actor was Born in Lafayette and not New Orleans as Widely Believed</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Numerous sources have given New Orleans, Louisiana as the actor’s birthplace. However, <a href=# rel=noopener>he stated in an interview</a> that he was&nbsp;born in Lafayette but considers New Orleans his home because he was able to live out his talent over there.</p><p>He was born James Landry Hébert on 4 October 1984.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2_James_Landry_Hebert_Was_Orphaned_at_a_Very_Young_Age></span><strong>2. James Landry Hébert Was Orphaned at a Very Young Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jamie lost both his parents when he was only a child. The account of their deaths is elusive to the media. Following this, he lived with his aunt for some years before he was adopted by a Chitimacha couple, Ted and Rhonda Darden who were on an Indian reservation program.</p><p>The Chitimacha couple got him enrolled in a tribal school in Chitimacha which made him the first non-native student in the school. James was able to relate to their culture and also developed the art of storytelling. Later, he earned his college degree in theater at Louisiana State University.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3_His_Passion_For_Acting_Was_Ignited_at_a_Very_Age></span><strong>3. His Passion For Acting Was Ignited at a Very Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>James developed a passion for acting at a very tender age even though he wasn’t born into it. According to the actor, a few months after his parent’s death, some actors came to shoot a movie in his hometown of Lafayette, Louisiana.</p><p>Be that as it may, his cousin was selected to be a part of the movie The Apostle (1997) and as a result, James’ passion for acting was kindled. He realized that even though he was an orphan from the local town of Bayou he could also be in movies.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=4_James_Landry_Hebert_Worked_as_a_Cast_Assistant_for_Over_Three_Years></span><strong>4. James Landry Hébert Worked as a Cast Assistant for Over Three Years</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>For some reason, Hollywood became interested in James’ Hometown and many of their shootings were done in Louisiana. As it turns out, Hebert was selected as a stand-in and photo double for Brad Pitt in the movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). After this, he was offered a day job to work alongside one of the best casting directors in Louisiana, Elizabeth Coulon.</p><p>Interestingly, Elizabeth made him her casting assistant for over three years, and later her casting associate. According to James, his position allowed him to read the principal roles of actors and also learned from their life experiences.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=5_His_Role_in_Step_Two_Was_Relatable_to_his_Real_Life_Experience></span><strong>5. His Role in Step Two Was Relatable to his Real Life Experience</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>While movies are fictional stories, a lot of actors have gone through the same storyline. James made it known that after reading the script of Step Two, he was able to relate to the characters, James and Webb who just like him were trying to find a home.</p><p>The first character James was coincidentally his namesake. Apart from that, the character had lost a lot of family members at a young age which was relatable to him. On the other hand, Webb, also an orphan was finding a place to call home and was overwhelmed with the feeling of loneliness.</p><p>In all this, James understood that though his life experiences were hurtful, they could be useful tools to get into movie characters. He considers the phenomenon of acting a private life in a public space. Some of his notable works include:</p><ul><li>Stanger Things</li><li>Westworld</li><li>Once Upon a Time</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=6_The_39-Year-Old_is_an_Original_Story_Teller></span><strong>6. The 39-Year-Old is an Original Story Teller</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The art of storytelling was introduced to James when he was enrolled at the Chitimacha tribal school. He was able to connect to the cultural practices and beliefs of his people. Also, he was able to relate better with them. As a way of portraying a better picture of this ancient and traditional art, James formed an original storytelling platform in collaboration with Hollywood filmmakers.</p><p>The platform was designed to give life to storytelling and teach native youths how to use the secret tool. James revealed that he would be honored to have the story of his life and adoption by locals being watched as a movie someday. Additionally, the program aims at preserving the culture of the village that raised him as a dynamic storyteller.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=7_He_Had_a_Committed_Longterm_Relationship_but_is_not_Married></span><strong>7.
