He went to Austin Community College after that, but he didn’t finish.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alex Jones: Personal Life Details</h2><p>Jones and his ex-wife Kelly Jones broke up in 2015. They had three kids together. In 2017, her ex-husband Kelly asked for sole custody or joint custody of their children. She said he wasn’t a stable person and was involved in crime. Kelly has been given the power to decide where their children will live. He will still be able to see them, but it will be up to Kelly.</p><p>Jones held a rally at the Capitol in 2020, where he was surrounded by supporters and called COVID-19 a hoax.

In 2000, Jones was one of seven Republicans running for Texas state representative. After a year, his show was broadcast on about 100 stations.</p><p>Jones started saying that the 9/11 attacks were planned by the Bush administration after they happened. It made some of the stations that used to air Jones’s show stop doing so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-108-1024x729.png><p>Jones spoke to international media at the annual Bilderberg meeting in England in June 2013. He spoke for a long time to about 2,000 protesters in the Grove Hotel’s yard.</p><p>Since then, Jones has held protests all over the US to show what he thinks and feels about different things going on in the country.</p><p>People have said that his website, InfoWars, is a fake news site and that it spreads conspiracy theories. When Facebook banned InfoWars for breaking its rules, Jones used another site called NewsWars to get around the ban.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alex Jones: Other Ventures</h2><p>Alex made his first documentary film, “America: Destroyed by Design,” in 1998. Since then, he has made about 20 more documentaries. He has also written two books: “9-11: Descent into Tyranny” which came out in 2002, and “The Answer to 1984 Is 1776” which came out in 2008.</p><p>Jones is the owner and director of the website InfoWars, which gets about 10 million visits per month. People have said that the website is fake news and that it spreads harmful conspiracy theories. At its peak, the site made more than $20 million per year, according to reports.</p><p>In 2017, the German magazine Der Spiegel found out that two-thirds of Jones’ income comes from sales of his own products, which he promotes on his show and through the InfoWars website. Some of the things they sell are vitamins, toothpaste, bulletproof vests, and other things.</p><p>John Oliver said on a 2017 episode of “Last Week Tonight” that Jones spends almost a quarter of his on-air time promoting products sold on his website. Many of these products claim to solve medical and economic problems that Jones says are caused by the conspiracy theories he talks about on his show.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, he kept doing strange things, and on March 12, 2020, the Attorney General of New York told him to stop because he said that the products he sold could cure COVID-19 without any proof. In April 2020, the FDA got involved, and Jones was told that if he kept selling the products, the government could seize and fine him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alex Jones: <strong>Defamation Damages</strong></h2><p>On August 3, 2022, a jury in Austin, Texas, said that Alex had to pay the Sandy Hook family $4.1 million in damages because they had won a previous defamation trial.</p><p>On August 5, 2022, the same Austin jury told Alex to pay another $45 million in punitive damages, bringing the total amount he had to pay to just under $50 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alex Jones: Controversies</h2><p>Jones is known for his very controversial ideas about things like the Oklahoma City bombing, the moon landing, 9/11, Sandy Hook, Obama, Hillary Clinton, white genocide, and not getting vaccinated. Jones thinks that many terrorist attacks were “inside jobs,” which means that the US government was involved.</p><p>He thinks that climate change is a lie made up by the World Bank so that a carbon tax can be used to control the world economy. In February 2018, former employees accused Jones of sexual harassment, racism against black people, and bias against Jews.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-109-1024x754.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Favorite Quotes By Alex Jones</h2><p>“The New World Order is a more palatable name for the Anglo-American world empire. It’s the planetary domination of London, New York, and Washington over the rest of the world. It’s hard to get people to join that or think they have a part in it if you called it the Anglo-American world empire.&nbsp;“Well, there’s something there for us too.” But that’s not what it is;&nbsp;it’s the Anglo-American New World Order.”&nbsp;</p><p>“If humanity has any hope of effecting real change for the better, it will not come from the Madison Avenue false reality makers who’ve cast&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Barack Obama</a>&nbsp;as the savior of the world. To alter our course from tyranny to liberty, to defeat the corrupt elite, we must get past the puppets and confront the real power structure of the planet.”&nbsp;</p><p>“&nbsp;Twenty years ago, it would not be expected that the New York Times would explain itself. The concept of what accountability.”</p><p><strong>Related Stories Recommended By Writer:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker Net Worth 2022: Inside ‘Hocus Pocus’ Star Made Mega Billionaire Status</a></li><li><a href=#>Tom Joyner’s Net Worth And Income (2022 Updated) – How Rich Is The American Radio Host In Actual</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX5a5psSMo6annaNiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html&text=Alex%20Jones%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20Alex%20Jones%20Make%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html&title=Alex%20Jones%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20Alex%20Jones%20Make%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html&title=Alex%20Jones%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20Alex%20Jones%20Make%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html&title=Alex%20Jones%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20Alex%20Jones%20Make%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falex-jones-net-worth.html&description=Alex%20Jones%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20Alex%20Jones%20Make%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cris-collinsworth-net-worth-197651.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cris Collinsworth Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-zooey-deschanel-age-albums-awards-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Zooey Deschanel?, Age, Films, Albums, Awards, Family, Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
