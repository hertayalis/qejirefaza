Shortly afterwards, Stanton-King launched a campaign to challenge Rep. John Lewis for his seat in the House.</p><p>King is a member of the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission, having been nominated to the position by President Donald Trump in 2018.</p><p>King voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, stating, "I pray that all polar opposites learn to Agape Love, live, and work together as brothers and sisters—or perish as fools. While I voted for Mr. Trump, my confidence remains in God, for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Prayers for president-elect Trump, Congressman Lewis, and everyone including leaders."</p><p>Martin Luther King Sr. wrote in his autobiography, "Alveda had been up the night before, she said, talking with her father and watching a television movie with him. He'd seemed unusually quiet . . . and not very interested in the film. But he had wanted to stay up and Alveda left him sitting in an easy chair, staring at the TV, when she went off to bed. . . . I had questions about A. D.'s death, and I still have them now. He was a good swimmer. Why did he drown? I don't know—I don't know that we will ever know what happened."</p><p>In 2012, King was a supporter of <a href=#>Herman Cain</a> for president and defended him from sexual harassment claims, saying, "A woman knows a skirt-chaser" and "Herman Cain is no skirt-chaser." She co-founded Women for Cain.</p><p>King spoke at Glenn Beck's "Restoring Honor" rally at the Lincoln Memorial in August 2010. ABC News reported that in King's speech, she hoped that "white privilege will become human privilege and that America will soon repent of the sin of racism and return itself to honor."</p><p>King has spoken out against same-sex marriage. In 2010 she equated same-sex marriage to genocide at a rally in Atlanta, saying, "We don't want genocide. We don't want to destroy the sacred institution of marriage." In a 2015 essay, she wrote that "life is a human and civil right, so is procreative marriage. . . . We must now go back to the beginning, starting with Genesis, and teach about God's plan for marriage."</p><p>After civil rights leader Rosa Parks died in 2005, Alveda King called Parks an inspiration for the pro-life cause, likening the injustice of racial segregation to abortion.</p><p>King produced the musical CD Let Freedom Ring in 2005. She has appeared in film and television as both Alveda King and Alveda King Beal. The Human Experience, a 2010 documentary film, featured commentary from King. She co-produced the video "Latter Rain" (2005) and co-executive-produced Pray for America (2015).</p><p>In 1994, according to Fox News, Alveda King has "long argued" that Dr. King was a Republican; she later wrote that she regretted the statement, writing "I said that without having all the facts" and noting that King in fact was neither a Democrat or a Republican.</p><p>In 1984 King ran for the seat of Georgia's 5th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. King challenged incumbent Representative Wyche Fowler. Fowler's predecessor, <a href=#>Andrew Young</a>, endorsed <a href=#>Hosea Williams</a>, who also challenged Fowler in the primary; Williams was one of Martin Luther King Jr.'s most trusted lieutenants and perhaps best known for organizing and leading the first Selma March.</p><p>In 1984, King supported the Reverend Jesse Jackson for president.</p><p>King is a pro-life activist. She had two abortions before adopting pro-life views following the birth of one of her children and her becoming a born-again Christian in 1983. King frames the issue as one of racial discrimination; she has referred to abortion as "womb-lynching" and accused Planned Parenthood of profiting from "aborting black babies." King is director of the activist group Civil Rights for the Unborn and is director of Priests for Life's African American outreach. In 1996 she denounced her aunt Coretta Scott King for her support for abortion rights. Angela D. Dillard classifies King as among most prominent black figures in the American religious right.</p><p>From 1979-82, King represented the 28th District in the Georgia House of Representatives. The district included Fulton County, and King served as a Democrat.</p><p>In 1969 her father, A. D. King, was found dead in the pool at his home. The cause of death was listed as an accidental drowning.</p><p>Alveda Celeste King (born January 22, 1951) is an American activist, author, and former state representative for the 28th District in the Georgia House of Representatives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVflrm3scOaZKShnpw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falveda-king.html&text=Alveda%20King%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falveda-king.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falveda-king.html&title=Alveda%20King%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falveda-king.html&title=Alveda%20King%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falveda-king.html&title=Alveda%20King%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falveda-king.html&description=Alveda%20King%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gary-rossington-funeral.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gary Rossington Funeral: When Is Gary Rossington Funeral?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./halloween-ripoff-costumes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="30+ Knock-Off Halloween Costumes That Aren't Even Trying to Hide Their Shamelessness">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
