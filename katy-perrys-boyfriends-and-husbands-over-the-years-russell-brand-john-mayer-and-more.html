Since her breakthrough in the late aughts with her debut single, <i>I Kissed a Girl</i>, Perry has successfully emerged as the ultimate hit machine. Perry is, undoubtedly, one of the best-recognized stars globally. &nbsp;</p><p>Throughout her two-decade-spanning musical journey, Perry has sold over 143 million records, making her one of the best-selling artists of all time. Born Kate Elizabeth Hudson on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, California, to her pastor parents, she took up the moniker to create the wonderful, larger-than-life character she had in mind. &nbsp;</p><h2>Inside Katy Perry's Dating History! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Since breaking into the Hollywood spotlight in 2008, Perry has not only been navigating a demanding professional life but also a tough personal life. The Grammy-nominated singer has had quite a romantic ride over the years, which includes a number of A-list stars. Katy was only 17 and yet to be shoved into the glamour world when she started dating musician <strong>Justin York.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/8/383981771_18308548996129054_5115258782095581311_n%20(1)%20(1)-1699454420323.jpg><p>The<i> Roar</i> hitmaker had another short-term relationship with Matt Thiessen, in 2005 before she kickstarted her first notable romance with actor <strong>John Lewis</strong>. The pair started dating in 2005 and broke up a year later. Katy's hitmaker, <i>The One That Got Away,</i> was inspired by her relationship with Lewis, who was found dead in 2012 after a history of substance addictions. &nbsp;</p><p>Perry and Gym Class Heroes frontman <strong>Travie McCoy</strong>, whom she started shortly after she dumped Lewis, was her first experience in a long-term relationship. The duo dated for two years and even appeared together on McCoy's MV, <i>Cupid's Chokehold.</i> The American Idol, who was fast rising to fame after her breakthrough debut, reportedly left McCoy to focus on her career. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/8/Snapinsta.app_364993383_1524386761697391_4410724280793918504_n_1080%20(1)%20(1)-1699454431969.jpg><p>Though Perry boasts a string of ex-boyfriends, only one of them has been lucky enough to walk down the aisle with the singer. Katy was famously married to actor <a href=#>Russell Brand,</a> whom she met during her cameo in <i>Get Him to the Greek</i>. Although the duo's intimate scene never made it to the screen, their onscreen intimacy swiftly translated into real life. &nbsp;</p><p>Perry and Brand left fans guessing for months before eventually going official in late 2009. The duo's romance turned whirlwind when the two announced their engagement in early 2010, followed by an unconventional, Hindu wedding in India in October 2010. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Perry says her soaring career was the reason Brand divorced her!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Fans had quite the hope for Perry and Brand, given their offbeat chemistry and frequent gushy moments, but the marriage didn't quite pan out as many had anticipated. The duo's marriage lasted a little more than a year and in December 2011, Russell confirmed their separation. While Perry kept mum, Russell shared that they ended things after realizing they were in different stages of life. &nbsp;</p><p>Perry later claimed that her soaring career was the catalyst behind their divorce. &nbsp;"I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they’re like, 'I can’t handle the equal,'" the<i> Roar</i> crooner <a href=#>shared.</a> Perry and Brand's long-dissolved, short-lived marriage popped into the headlines recently after Russell got accused of several assault allegations. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/8/312498454_199360789122902_8338810161955384302_n%20(1)%20(1)-1699454468862.jpg><p>Perry's dream of a perfect marriage and an idealistic world was crushed after Russell called it off with her via a text. The<i> Hot n Cold </i>crooner called the period an emotional trauma. But the bitter experience didn't stop Perry in her quest to find the one. She had a rollercoaster romance with singer <strong>John Mayer</strong>, whom she dated on and off from 2012 to 2014. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Everything to Know About Katy Perry's Relationship with Orlando Bloom! &nbsp;</h3><p>Anyone keeping up with Hollywood's affairs would certainly know that Perry has been long dating actor <strong>Orlando Bloom</strong>, with whom she welcomed a daughter, <a href=#>Daisy Dove</a>, in August 2020. Even though the pair hold the spot of a power couple in the industry, their journey has been far from smooth. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/8/Snapinsta.app_343582970_871633804663223_4092215504403040585_n_1080%20(1)%20(1)-1699454449975.jpg><p>Perry started dating the <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> actor after their meet-cute at a Golden Globe afterparty in January 2016. Just a couple of months into their romantic bliss, Katy and Bloom checked a milestone as they went Instagram-official in May 2016. The two were on a break, like Ross and Rachel's break, for a year, before rekindling their romance in late 2018. &nbsp;</p><p>The singer and actor got engaged on 2019 Valentine's Day. The two were one of the many Hollywood couples whose wedding plans were thwarted by the unprecedented Covid pandemic. The couple still remains engaged and that might be a concern for Katy's fervent fans, but the Grammy nominee has time and again asserted that all is well between the two. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/8/337562386_1272877950330278_1878809699306865482_n%20(1)%20(1)-1699454455983.jpg><p>Earlier last year, Perry shared that she and Bloom were still confused about their wedding destination. "We're still trying for it to work out," Perry said, adding, But every couple of months it's like, 'New variant! New variant! New variant." &nbsp;</p><p>Perry and Orlando's three-year-old daughter made her public debut at her mom's Vegas residency. "Daisy, I love you so much," Katy, 39, exclaimed as she paused her concert to express her love for her daughter, who sat alongside Bloom.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqSYrbFdpbKzvtisZJunqZu%2FqrHNnapmmZ6ZeqnB0puYp5yjYry3sdFmq6GdXa6yor7SZqmuq6Oaua15wauYp5xdn7ypuoymmLKdomKur7CMpqarnQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkaty-perrys-boyfriends-and-husbands-over-the-years-russell-brand-john-mayer-and-more.html&text=Russell%20Brand%2c%20John%20Mayer%2c%20and%20More&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkaty-perrys-boyfriends-and-husbands-over-the-years-russell-brand-john-mayer-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkaty-perrys-boyfriends-and-husbands-over-the-years-russell-brand-john-mayer-and-more.html&title=Russell%20Brand%2c%20John%20Mayer%2c%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkaty-perrys-boyfriends-and-husbands-over-the-years-russell-brand-john-mayer-and-more.html&title=Russell%20Brand%2c%20John%20Mayer%2c%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkaty-perrys-boyfriends-and-husbands-over-the-years-russell-brand-john-mayer-and-more.html&title=Russell%20Brand%2c%20John%20Mayer%2c%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkaty-perrys-boyfriends-and-husbands-over-the-years-russell-brand-john-mayer-and-more.html&description=Russell%20Brand%2c%20John%20Mayer%2c%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./susanne-zenor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Susanne Zenor">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jake-cherry.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jake Cherry">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
