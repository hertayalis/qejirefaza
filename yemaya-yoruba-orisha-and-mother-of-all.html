A mother goddess of great depth and divine force. She is seen as both nurturing and protecting.</p><h2><strong>Who is Yemaya?</strong></h2><p>Yemaya is also known as Yemaja, a moon goddess governing providence, luck, water, and fertility. She is symbolized by the fish, the color blue, and the crescent moon.</p><p>Yemaya is often portrayed as a beautiful mermaid. Motherly and protective she watches out for fishermen at sea. It is said that humans were created when her water broke creating the rivers and human life.</p><p>She is the patron goddess of the Ogun River in Nigeria and her name means mother of fish children. She is often portrayed as a mermaid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/8adc5dcf-f372-4995-9538-16484558e4bd/yemaya.jpeg><p>Yemaya is seen as a goddess of balance and helps those who struggle with mental health. She rules over the surface of the ocean and is associated with the Orisha Olokin (who is variously described as female, male, or hermaphrodite). Olokin represents the darkest depths of the Ocean and the unconscious mind. Like the yin and yang together they form a balance.</p><p>The Goddess Yemaya was brought from Africa to the Americas during the slave trade. She was worshipped and kept alive during this horrific time in history and today flourishes in many cultures.</p><p>In her paper, <a href=#>Nobody’s Mammy</a> Yemayá as Fierce Foremother in Afro-Cuban Religions, Elizabeth Pérez, states that the “vision of Yemayá as a fierce foremother was conveyed through oral tradition”.</p><p>As Yemaya spread through the Americas those cultures adapted her into their lifestyle. In the process, Yemaya developed many names and pronunciations.</p><h3><strong>Name variants:</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p>Africa: Yemoja, Ymoja, Iemanja Nana Borocum, Iemanja Bomi, Iemanja Boci</p></li><li><p>Brazil: Yemanjá, Iemanjá, Imanjá</p></li><li><p>Cuba: Yemaya, Yemayah, Iemanya</p></li><li><p>Haiti: La Sirène, LaSiren (in Vodou)</p></li><li><p>USA (New Orleans Hoodoo): Yemalla, Yemana</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Where Is Yemaya From?</strong></h2><p>Yemaya originates with the Yoruba people in Africa. Today these people live in what is present-day Nigeria, Benin, and Togo. Many descendants of the Yoruba live in the Caribbean, Brazil, and the United States.</p><p>People often celebrate their connections to Africa by honoring the Gods and Goddesses of their ancestorial lands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/fd672efe-36c1-4e65-90de-3c9ab432cacd/303px-A_Yoruba_woman_garbed_in_traditional_clothing_%282%29.png><h2><strong>Yemaya’s Feast Days</strong></h2><p>Yemaya, the Yoruba Goddess of the ocean and motherhood, is celebrated throughout the year on various feast days. These celebrations are filled with rituals, dances, music, and offerings to honor and show gratitude to Yemaya.</p><p>Here are some of the important Yemaya Feast Days observed in the Yoruba tradition:</p><p>Yemaya has several feast days as numerous cultures have adopted her into their mythos. In the Caribbean and South America, she is often combined with Catholic Saints.</p><p>Yemaya’s Feast Day is September 7 which coincides with Diosa del Mar, the Catholic celebration for the Lady of the Sea.</p><p>However, in Brazil, they celebrate this Orisha on December 31 when they float cakes out to sea on tiny rafts.</p><p>Others associate her with Mother’s Day.</p><p><br>1. <strong>Yemaya Day</strong>: She is celebrated on <strong>February 2</strong> as part of Our Lady of Candelaria. Devotees of Yemaya gather at the shores of the ocean or near rivers to honor this powerful goddess. They offer fruits, flowers, and other objects associated with Yemaya to the water, seeking her blessings and protection for the upcoming year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/dd0c684f-3f51-4951-bec1-76b5812376f7/Untitled+design+-+2023-06-19T160155.974.png><p><br>2. <strong>Feast of the Starfish</strong>: Celebrated on the <strong>7th of September,</strong> this special day commemorates the connection between Yemaya and the starfish, which symbolizes resilience and adaptability.</p><p>Devotees participate in rituals that involve wearing starfish-shaped adornments and making offerings to honor Yemaya's nurturing nature. It coincides with the Catholic day for Diosa Del Mar, the Lady of the Sea.</p><p><br>3. <strong>New Moon Ceremony</strong>: As Yemaya is strongly associated with the moon, her devotees gather for a sacred ceremony on <strong>every New Moon</strong>. They perform rituals, prayers, and dances to seek her guidance, and wisdom, and foster spiritual growth.</p><p><br>4. <strong>Feast of the Seven Seas</strong>: Celebrated on the <strong>8th of December</strong>, this feast day marks the domain of Yemaya over the seven seas. Devotees express their devotion by offering seven types of fruits, representing each sea, and participating in processions and dance performances dedicated to Yemaya.</p><p><br>5. <strong>Yemaya Festival</strong>: The Yemaya Festival, also known as the Yemoja Festival, takes place annually during the <strong>Summer Solstice, around the 21st of June</strong>. This vibrant celebration pays homage to Yemaya's role as the Great Mother and protector of all living beings. It includes colorful processions, drumming, singing, and offerings of fruits, seafood, and other items associated with the ocean.</p><p><br>6. <strong>Feast of Abundance</strong>: Celebrated on the <strong>last Sunday of October,</strong> this feast day is dedicated to honoring Yemaya's attribute of bringing abundance and prosperity into the lives of her devotees. Offerings of fruits, vegetables, grains, and other symbols of wealth are made to express gratitude for her blessings.<br></p><h2><strong>Yemayas Origin Story</strong></h2><p>Yemaya is often described as the wife of Orisha Oko. She is said to be the mother of many but never to have given birth. Her children are typically known as Ogun, Sango, Oya, Osun, Oba, Orisha Oko, Babaluaiye, and Osoosi.</p><p>She was typically portrayed as having a large womb and breasts for having numerous children. Rivers were formed when her water broke.</p><p>In another mythos, it is said that she was brutally raped by her son. She went into hiding and cursed her son to death. She regretted her actions and became severely depressed, taking her own life. While she was dying she gave birth to 14 children.</p><p>She has also been called the sister /wife of Aganju, the god of the soil, and the mother of Oya, Goddess of the winds.</p><p>Interested in African Goddesses?

Oshun was a beautiful orisha with a resplendent white dress and long flowing black hair.</p><p>She was a kind ruler and queen of the land. However, a terrible war erupted causing great chaos.</p><p>Oshun was forced to flee and sell everything she had to survive. She became destitute and filled with such sadness and anxiety that her hair fell out.</p><p>Yemaya came to her sister’s aid, reminding her she was still a queen. Oshun’s dress was yellowed with dirt and Yemaya made it golden and declared that all the gold would belong to her sister. Yemaya cut off her own lovely tresses and made a beautiful wig for her sister to wear.</p><p>Parents often tell their children this story as an example of how siblings should love and support each other.</p><p>Check out my YouTube Channel</p><h2><strong>Divination</strong></h2><p>Yemaya was very gifted in divination. As a patron goddess, she can help you to explore and excel at divination arts.</p><p><strong>She was especially gifted in these forms of divination:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p>Opele - a divination chain used in Afro-American religions. It helps identify personal problems and their solutions to restore harmony and balance.</p></li><li><p>Dowsing - used to locate groundwater, gemstones and gravesites.</p></li><li><p>Dilogún - the casting of cowrie shells.</p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/68dfa3fa-c054-4c37-8c12-41a14f3e43bd/Untitled+design+-+2023-06-19T182100.917.png><h2>Dilogun Divination:</h2><p><br>Dilogun divination is an ancient practice deeply rooted in African spirituality, specifically stemming from the Yoruba religion—an indigenous belief system prevalent in Nigeria, Benin, and Togo. Also known as Merindilogun or Cowry Shell Divination, this intriguing divinatory method allows practitioners to communicate with the Orishas, the powerful African ancestral spirits.</p><p>The word "Dilogun" literally translates to "twenty-one", referring to the divination system's main tool—an assortment of twenty-one cowry shells. These shells hold profound symbolic significance in African cultures and have been used for centuries as a means of guidance, prophecy, and spiritual communication.</p><p>Each shell in the divination set represents one of the twenty-one primary Orishas, creating a conduit through which spiritual messages can be received and interpreted.</p><p>To conduct a Dilogun divination session, the diviner begins by invoking the presence of the Orishas, seeking their guidance and blessings. After establishing this sacred connection, the diviner proceeds to cast the cowry shells on a divination board or sacred cloth known as a opon Ifá or erindinlogun.</p><p>This board is adorned with intricate patterns and symbols that hold specific significance in the divination process. Once the shells are cast, their positions and formations on the divination board are carefully observed and interpreted by the diviner.</p><p>The shells may fall in various configurations, revealing intricate patterns, symbolic representations, and messages from the Orishas. The diviner uses their vast knowledge of the Orishas' characteristics, stories, and mythologies to analyze the patterns and provide guidance to the individual seeking divination.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/67cd9be0-2c7c-4d47-bd9c-768b02339786/480px-Yemaya_New_Orleans_10_Years_After_Katrina.jpg><h2><strong>Honoring Yemaya</strong></h2><p>Before embarking on any spiritual practice, it is crucial to gain knowledge and understand the traditions, beliefs, and symbols associated with Yemaya. Dive into the rich Yoruba mythology, learn about her stories, attributes, and the cultural practices surrounding her worship.</p><h3><strong>Give Thanks</strong></h3><p>Thank her for her blessings</p><p><a href=#>Lilith Dorsey </a>tells in her book that enslaved Africans who were forced to travel by ship from Africa to the Americas often cried out to Yemaya. When reaching land they kissed the ground and said “Oh my Yemaya, Thank you”.</p><p>You may also use the term “ Omio Yemoja” which translates to water of Yemoja during chants.</p><h3><strong>Music and Dance</strong></h3><p>Listen to some traditional music. Cuban singer <a href=#>Celia Cruz</a> sang songs to Yemaya.</p><p>Summon her with a gourd rattle decorated with beads and cowrie shells.</p><p>Dance! Dancing and music are much loved by the goddess. We see this reflected throughout Africa and the Caribbean where dances are dedicated to her. The women’s twirling skirts represent the waves of the ocean. So dance to your heart’s content!</p><h3><strong>Prayer and Meditation</strong></h3><p><br>Engage in prayer and meditation to connect with Yemaya's energy. Create your own personal prayers or recite existing Yoruba prayers honoring her. Reflect on her qualities,</p><h2><strong>Create an Altar</strong></h2><p><br>Setting up a sacred space or altar dedicated to Yemaya is a powerful way to honor her. Find a suitable location, ideally near a source of water, such as a river, lake, or even a small bowl of water.</p><p>Cover the altar with a clean cloth in shades of blue and white, representing the colors associated with Yemaya. Place objects that symbolize the sea, such as seashells, coral, fish figurines, or images of waves and dolphins.</p><p>Present her with white flowers, especially roses and lilies, known for their purity.</p><p>Honor her with a <a href=#>statue at your altar</a>, blue and white candles, and lovely scents. Use the list below to find herbs and flowers that Yemaya loves. Don’t forget to leave out a bowl of moon water!</p><p>In addition, you might want to pick up some <a href=#>Florida Water.</a> Not necessarily made from waters around the state of Florida but a magical cologne used in worship. Typically made with bergamot, cinnamon, and lemon.</p><h3><strong>Offerings</strong></h3><p><br>Offerings are a significant part of honoring Yemaya and expressing gratitude for her blessings. The number 7 is important to her. Place offerings in a circle of seven.
