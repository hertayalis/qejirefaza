The track star disappeared without a trace after waiting for her boyfriend, turning her family’s world upset down.</p><p id=par-2_50>While fans don’t think the missing teenager is dead, they are at a loss when it comes to figuring out her whereabouts. Based on the clues given to the viewers so far, many believe her former track coach, who she previously dated, might have something to <a href=#>do with her disappearance</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ntare-Guma-Mbaho-Mwine-Yolonda-Ross.png><h2><strong>Keisha’s relationship with her track coach</strong></h2><p id=par-3_37>In Season 2, high school senior Keisha (Birgundi Baker), who previously had a fling with Emmett (Jacob Latimore), began a romantic relationship with her adult track coach, Ricky (Levenix Riddle), on the heels of her father’s death.</p><p id=par-4_41>The coach showed up at Sonny’s with a different teenage girl, alarming Emmett, even though Ricky claimed, “whatever you think it is, it’s not.” The new manager informed the owner of the adult-child relationship and compared him to disgraced singer, R.Kelly.</p><p id=par-5_42>A furious Sonny (Cedric Young) then picked up the phone to call the police, but Emmett stopped him because he wanted to tell Keisha what he saw. Once he told her, the teenager revealed she and the grown coach had parted ways.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/LenaWaithe/status/1278075944016572416</p></figure><p id=par-6_37>The young father still asked for Brandon’s (Jason Mitchell) help to deal with Ricky, and the chef turned to his newfound affiliation with the 63rd Street Mob due to his dealings with Otis “Douda” Perry (Curtiss Cook).</p><p id=par-7_33>One of the gang’s leaders, Reggie (Barton Fitzpatrick), confronted the coach and attempted to scare him away from dating teenage girls. While it seemingly worked, some viewers think the coach might have returned.</p><h2>‘The Chi’ <strong>fans think the track coach kidnapped Keisha</strong></h2><p id=par-8_54>In the third season, Keisha obtained a track scholarship for college. However, she admitted she didn’t want to leave Southside Chicago. While waiting to meet up with her new boyfriend, Nuck (Cortez Smith), the teenager suddenly disappeared from a bus stop, shortly after making eye contact with a now-homeless Ronnie (Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine).</p><p id=par-9_40>After he and Keisha’s step-mom, Dre (Miriam A. Hyman), confronted a person of interest, he pointed them to a body he believed belonging to the missing teenager. Although the parents did locate the young girl, it was not their daughter.</p><p id=par-10_39>Additionally, Kevin (Alex R. Hibbert) sought the help of Trig (Luke James) and Imani (Jasmine Davis), who searched Nuck’s trap house but came up empty. Therefore, fans were at a loss and didn’t understand what happened to the teenager.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-11_25>Some believe Ricky might have something to do with her disappearance because Keisha appears trapped in a room wearing a track jacket in the trailer.</p><p id=par-12_47>When talking to people about her possible whereabouts, a high school girl noted she and Keisha&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>“used to talk to the same guy,”</a>&nbsp;which many believe could be the track coach. Additionally, the premiere episode reminded viewers of her previous relationship with Ricky, leading several to think it’s essential.</p><h2><strong>Other fan theories about Keisha’s whereabouts</strong></h2><p id=par-13_24>Initially, some viewers thought the suspicious man Ronnie chased had something to do with the missing teenager before the man identified the wrong female.</p><p id=par-14_28>Others think Papa’s dad (Tory O. Davis) might be connected somehow due to his&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>“shady”</a>&nbsp;behavior involving mayoral candidate Camille Hallaway (Lena Waithe) paying him to speak at his church.</p><p id=par-15_35>Another popular theory revolves around Jada’s (Yolanda Ross) new love interest, her coworker Tomas (Salvador Chacon). They think he possibly has a habit of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>busting in on appointments</a>&nbsp;and could have something to do with scouting girls.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-4 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/LenaWaithe/status/1281269310489387013</p></figure><p id=par-16_36>Additionally, a flashback of Nina (Tyla Abercrumbie) finding out about Keisha’s birth control occurred in the same episode, leading many to believe she could have gotten it at the same clinic where Jada and Tomas work.</p><p id=par-17_35>Therefore, they could have crossed paths there, and he would have access to her records due to his position. Keep watching&nbsp;The Chi&nbsp;Sundays at 9 p.m. EST on Showtime to find out what happened to Keisha.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMnJ%2BiZaSnrqS3jJymmpuYYrimtdKhmGacmaiusbzEmqmappOae6nAzKVm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-chi-track-coach-keisha-disappearance-html.html&text=Why%20Fans%20Think%20the%20Track%20Coach%20Has%20Something%20to%20Do%20With%20Keisha%27s%20Disappearance&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-chi-track-coach-keisha-disappearance-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-chi-track-coach-keisha-disappearance-html.html&title=Why%20Fans%20Think%20the%20Track%20Coach%20Has%20Something%20to%20Do%20With%20Keisha%27s%20Disappearance" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-chi-track-coach-keisha-disappearance-html.html&title=Why%20Fans%20Think%20the%20Track%20Coach%20Has%20Something%20to%20Do%20With%20Keisha%27s%20Disappearance" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-chi-track-coach-keisha-disappearance-html.html&title=Why%20Fans%20Think%20the%20Track%20Coach%20Has%20Something%20to%20Do%20With%20Keisha%27s%20Disappearance" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-chi-track-coach-keisha-disappearance-html.html&description=Why%20Fans%20Think%20the%20Track%20Coach%20Has%20Something%20to%20Do%20With%20Keisha%27s%20Disappearance" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./elijah-blue-allman-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elijah Blue Allman Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-kardashian-family-net-worth-275103.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Kardashian Family Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
