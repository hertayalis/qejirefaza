As peaceful protestors took to the streets to rally together against Municipal Judge Wendy Pew’s decision to dismiss all charges against Officer Mark Dial, Meatball live-streamed the ensuing events.</p><p>Dial shot and killed Eddie Irizarry through a car window <a href=#>in an act of police brutality</a> during a routine traffic stop in August 2023. But the charges of murder and manslaughter were dismissed, so people took to the Philadelphia streets to peacefully protest. But those <a href=#>peaceful protests</a> later turned into looting, which officials believe Meatball was responsible for, so she was arrested.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@dayjiamainpage</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Influencer Meatball was arrested for her involvement in widespread Philadelphia looting.</h2><p>In order to show her support for Irizarry, Meatball joined the protests on Sept. 26. With almost 200,000 Instagram followers, her reach goes far and wide, as does her influence. So when she live-streamed the events that night, officers used the videos to find the locations, identities, and actions of “looters,” whom Meatball allegedly encouraged.</p><p>“Tell the police they’re either gonna lock me up tonight, or it’s gonna get lit, it’s gonna be a movie,” she said in one of the videos. Unfortunately, they chose the former option. Throughout the streams, Meatball laughs and encourages the looters, even yelling, “Free iPhones! Free iPhones!” at one point.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TikTok: @LvJonJon215 📲 (@lvjonjon215)</a></p></figure><p>But all of this is part of a bigger movement to stop police brutality. “This is what happens when we don’t get justice in this city,” she shouted. Unfortunately, her part in the looting, which affected corporate storefronts of Apple, Foot Locker, and Lululemon, led to Meatball’s arrest.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meatball was handed eight charges related to the looting.</h2><p>The next day, Meatball was arrested and held on $25,000 bail, which she posted shortly after. Her mugshot, which has been circulating the internet, shows Meatball crying after an emotional series of events. She was charged with burglary, criminal trespassing, conspiracy, criminal mischief, riot with the intent to commit a felony, and criminal use of a communication facility.</p><p>"[Meatball] may be responsible for a lot of other people being arrested because she encouraged those folks and they were, quite frankly, dumb enough to engage and participate and there are going to be consequences for that," interim Chief of Police John Stanford said of Blackwell's involvement.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Because of the tactical response and good work by our officers last night, 52 individuals were arrested including 3 juveniles and 2 guns recovered. Criminal behavior should never be acceptable in our city because our communities deserve better!</p>— John M. Stanford (@PPDCommish) <a href=#>September 27, 2023</a></figure><p>Despite getting arrested, Meatball’s mother supports her. When she spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC10</a> about the events, she ended her statement by saying, “Free Dayjia,” when her daughter was still in custody. Police, however, insist that the looting wasn't related to the peaceful protests and that they were executed by “opportunists.”</p><p>Mayor Jim Kenney also felt the need to chime in. “[Meatball was] live-streaming the whole thing, wound up with 12,000 followers, and created, basically incited the riot," he said. "She's in jail." However, the incident has simply gained Meatball more followers and support as she tries to stand on the right side of history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnrunuNSepZydomK6pq3Tm5ilpF2Wv7Ox0q2cnQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finfluencer-meatball-arrested.html&text=Influencer%20%26quot%3bMeatball%26quot%3b%20Was%20Arrested%20During%20a%20Series%20of%20Philadelphia%20Protests&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finfluencer-meatball-arrested.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finfluencer-meatball-arrested.html&title=Influencer%20%26quot%3bMeatball%26quot%3b%20Was%20Arrested%20During%20a%20Series%20of%20Philadelphia%20Protests" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finfluencer-meatball-arrested.html&title=Influencer%20%26quot%3bMeatball%26quot%3b%20Was%20Arrested%20During%20a%20Series%20of%20Philadelphia%20Protests" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finfluencer-meatball-arrested.html&title=Influencer%20%26quot%3bMeatball%26quot%3b%20Was%20Arrested%20During%20a%20Series%20of%20Philadelphia%20Protests" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finfluencer-meatball-arrested.html&description=Influencer%20%26quot%3bMeatball%26quot%3b%20Was%20Arrested%20During%20a%20Series%20of%20Philadelphia%20Protests" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jerry-springer-net-worth-155460.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jerry Springer Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hyperboreans-from-age-of-conan-and-dark-horse-312486.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hyperboreans from Age of Conan and Dark Horse">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
