If programs didnâ€™t find the answers they wanted at a particular position, this is the time to scour the portal one last time for a veteran player who can compete in preseason camp. If players arenâ€™t happy with their position on the depth chart, this is a chance to look around for a better situation.</p><p>By my count, Michigan had 78 players on its spring roster who received scholarship offers as transfers or high school recruits, plus several former walk-ons. The Wolverines have another 16 players who signed in the Class of 2023 and are scheduled to arrive in the summer. No matter how you do the math, Michigan has more talented players than available jobs. The Wolverines also have a position or two that could benefit from the addition of a veteran player if the right fit emerges.</p><a href=# data-amp-replace=CLIENT_ID class="sc-f3dd6d06-16 jkrWUg" readability=1><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-18 jMggnu">GO FURTHER</p><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-19 gXOwpd">Michigan football transfer portal preview: 5 positions to watch in spring window</p></a><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">BYU adds a Utah State LB</h2><p>BYU lands a commitment from Utah State transfer LB AJ Vongphachanh.

Locke and Evers both arrived this offseason as redshirt freshmen in what figured to be a fascinating battle to become Wisconsinâ€™s future at quarterback, given that Mordecai will be a sixth-year senior. So far, Locke has surged while Evers has endured growing pains.</p><a href=# data-amp-replace=CLIENT_ID class="sc-f3dd6d06-16 jkrWUg" readability=1><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-18 jMggnu">GO FURTHER</p><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-19 gXOwpd">Who is Wisconsin football QB of the future?

As a junior at Patrick Henry High School, Smith knew the shoulder injury suffered in baseball that spring meant there would be no senior football season that fall.</p><p>And that left Smith with a difficult choice.</p><p>He could either stick it out at Patrick Henry, sit out the football season and play baseball again that spring before heading to college. Or he could transfer to Louisa County High School, which had the academic setup to let Smith graduate early and head to college that winter. At the time, Smith, a wide receiver, was committed to Wake Forest in the same recruiting class as Sam Hartman. The two planned to room together.</p><p><a href=#>Read more here.</a></p><p>(Photo: USA Today)</p><a href=# data-amp-replace=CLIENT_ID class="sc-f3dd6d06-16 jkrWUg" readability=1><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-18 jMggnu">GO FURTHER</p><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-19 gXOwpd">Kaleb Smithâ€™s transfer to Notre Dame is a â€˜full circleâ€™ ending to his college career</p></a><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Five things I'll be watching when the portal opens</h2><p>When the first 45-day transfer period closed on Jan. 18, more than 1,500 FBS scholarship players had entered the transfer portal in this 2022-23 cycle. Since then, fewer than 100 players have entered as graduate transfers. Transfer recruiting cooled off considerably during the spring, just as coaches had hoped. But for the next 15 days, starting on Saturday, college football players are once again free to move about the country.</p><p>From the quarterback market to the Group of 5 risers, <a href=#>here are five things to watch</a> when the portal reopens from April 15 to 30 for another wave of transfers.</p><a href=# data-amp-replace=CLIENT_ID class="sc-f3dd6d06-16 jkrWUg" readability=1.5><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-18 jMggnu">GO FURTHER</p><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-19 gXOwpd">Five stories to watch when college footballâ€™s transfer portal opens, from QBs to G5 risers</p></a><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">How Michigan's portal additions fit</h2><p>Not so long ago, Michigan was stuck on the wrong side of the transfer portal turnstile.</p><p>The Wolverines had 18 scholarship players or contributing walk-ons who entered the portal between August 2020 and July 2021. Outside of a few timely graduate transfers like Olu Oluwatimi and Mike Danna, Michigan wasnâ€™t adding significantly from the portal to offset the attrition.</p><p>All of that flipped in the most recent cycle. Michiganâ€™s portal losses were minimal, with quarterback Cade McNamara and tight end Erick All as the most notable departures. On the other side of the ledger, the Wolverines fortified their roster with seven transfers, several of whom could contend for starting jobs in the fall.</p><p>So what changed? Was it a shift in strategy? A more flexible admissions process? Or is it, as coach Jim Harbaugh contends, a matter of Michigan emerging as an attractive destination for transfers?</p><p><a href=#>Read more here.</a></p><a href=# data-amp-replace=CLIENT_ID class="sc-f3dd6d06-16 jkrWUg" readability=1><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-18 jMggnu">GO FURTHER</p><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-19 gXOwpd">How Michigan football transfer portal additions fit: Who could win a 2023 starting job?</p></a><p>Load more updates</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57y6KtnmWSobyov46cpqWklZyybrLOqKubmZyherW%2BwKeqn52iYr2wvtOao2akmauybsDRmpqknaJiwLG%2ByKeeZqifp8GiuIympq%2Bdo2Kur7CMpZitnaOpeq%2Bx1qxmgbCaiaCnlbaOipuJX2WBsrPHnZhyonmpsXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcollege-football-transfer-portal-live-tracker-spring-portal-moves-and-latest-news.html&text=UNLV%20QB%20enters%20portal%20-%20The%20Athletic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcollege-football-transfer-portal-live-tracker-spring-portal-moves-and-latest-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcollege-football-transfer-portal-live-tracker-spring-portal-moves-and-latest-news.html&title=UNLV%20QB%20enters%20portal%20-%20The%20Athletic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcollege-football-transfer-portal-live-tracker-spring-portal-moves-and-latest-news.html&title=UNLV%20QB%20enters%20portal%20-%20The%20Athletic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcollege-football-transfer-portal-live-tracker-spring-portal-moves-and-latest-news.html&title=UNLV%20QB%20enters%20portal%20-%20The%20Athletic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcollege-football-transfer-portal-live-tracker-spring-portal-moves-and-latest-news.html&description=UNLV%20QB%20enters%20portal%20-%20The%20Athletic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bob-whitfield.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bob Whitfield Age, Net worth: Wife, Bio-Wiki, Kids, Weight">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rhobh-star-lisa-rinna-shares-heartfelt-story-behind-her-2022-peoples-choice-awards-look.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="RHOBH star Lisa Rinna shares heartbreaking story behind her 2022 Peoples Choice Awards look">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
